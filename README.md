On 1 February 2018, the Shared Data Unit [reported](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42403590) out of around 11,000 police officers lost from 2012-17 across forces in England and Wales, 1,500 worked in neighbourhoods - around one in seven. 

At the same time around nearly one in three PCSOs - originally intended to be the "eyes and ears" of the community - were also axed, according to our analysis of Home Office figures.

The government said it had promised an extra Â£450m for policing starting next year and nature of crime was changing; officers were now needed to deal with growing problems in non-traditional areas like online fraud and identity theft. 

Local campaigners said a visible police presence in communities deterred criminals and helped to gather intelligence.
